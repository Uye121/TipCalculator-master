## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had very limited experience with iOS app development. Controlling what to 
display on the different UIViews and make sure the changes I want are displayed
correctly in the different views was very challenging for me. I also had trouble 
making the gif because I never made any gif before and was a bit confused about 
how to make them.
